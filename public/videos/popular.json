        "description": "Today AD is welcomed to Columbus, Ohio by Debby Ryan and Josh Dun for a tour of their fascinating, ‘treehouse fantasy’ home. It might be surprising to hear of a sparkling young actor and her rocker husband setting up their first house in the “Arch City,” but Ryan and Dun relish an impulsive departure from the script. When they discovered the property and decided to make it their home, the actor and musician tapped Fawn Galli and Ashley Moyer to bring their domestic dream to life. From a basement boxing ring and a cold-plunge pool on the back porch, to a recording studio and a dramatic stone bust of Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, that dream has come to full fruition. “I remember walking through the house and feeling like there was so much room to put our personalities into it,” says Dun. “Not only was this the first house that we designed together, but it was really the first time that both of us felt the freedom to put our mark on a place.”\r\n\r\nSee more of Debby and Josh's home here: https://www.architecturaldigest.com/gallery/inside-debby-ryan-and-josh-duns-treehouse-fantasy-home-in-columbus-ohio\r\n\r\nShop Debby and Josh’s home style!\r\n\r\nPlants/accessories:\r\nPolspotten Set of 4 Tattoo Cups: https://fave.co/40cH4Rc\r\nStagg Electric Kettle: https://amzn.to/42o4wge\r\n(Similar) Olivia & May 2 Piece Modern Ceramic Planter Pots: https://goto.target.com/4P5jaG\r\nHero Giant Corn Stool: https://amzn.to/3n8oyuO\r\n(Similar) Super Moss Deco Moss Small Mushroom: https://amzn.to/42ouCj7\r\n(Similar) Pose Mirror Hand Embellished: https://fave.co/3JTGe6D\r\nOpalhouse Outdoor Ceramic Planter: https://goto.target.com/9gGaVQ\r\nByredo Tree House Candle: https://fave.co/3LFYt0u\r\nMasion Margiela ‘REPLICA’ By The Fireplace Candle: https://fave.co/3JVwXuR\r\n(Similar) Sizikato Frog Incense Burner: https://amzn.to/3JVqHDn\r\nAcrylic Four in a Row: https://fave.co/3Z7cAyR\r\nPlunge The Cold Plunge: https://fave.co/402EsWb\r\n\r\nLighting:\r\nUrban Outfitters Wally Table Lamp: https://fave.co/3lpHxkj\r\nElk Home Transit Chandelier: https://fave.co/3Jvd5gG\r\nEtsy Gallery Paint Co.

          "title": "Inside Debby Ryan & Josh Dun's Fascinating Ohio Home | Open Door | Architectural Digest",
          "description": "Today AD is welcomed to Columbus, Ohio by Debby Ryan and Josh Dun for a tour of their fascinating, ‘treehouse fantasy’ home. It might be surprising to hear of a sparkling young actor and her rocker husband setting up their first house in the “Arch City,” but Ryan and Dun relish an impulsive departure from the script. When they discovered the property and decided to make it their home, the actor and musician tapped Fawn Galli and Ashley Moyer to bring their domestic dream to life. From a basement boxing ring and a cold-plunge pool on the back porch, to a recording studio and a dramatic stone bust of Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, that dream has come to full fruition. “I remember walking through the house and feeling like there was so much room to put our personalities into it,” says Dun. “Not only was this the first house that we designed together, but it was really the first time that both of us felt the freedom to put our mark on a place.”\r\n\r\nSee more of Debby and Josh's home here: https://www.architecturaldigest.com/gallery/inside-debby-ryan-and-josh-duns-treehouse-fantasy-home-in-columbus-ohio\r\n\r\nShop Debby and Josh’s home style!\r\n\r\nPlants/accessories:\r\nPolspotten Set of 4 Tattoo Cups: https://fave.co/40cH4Rc\r\nStagg Electric Kettle: https://amzn.to/42o4wge\r\n(Similar) Olivia & May 2 Piece Modern Ceramic Planter Pots: https://goto.target.com/4P5jaG\r\nHero Giant Corn Stool: https://amzn.to/3n8oyuO\r\n(Similar) Super Moss Deco Moss Small Mushroom: https://amzn.to/42ouCj7\r\n(Similar) Pose Mirror Hand Embellished: https://fave.co/3JTGe6D\r\nOpalhouse Outdoor Ceramic Planter: https://goto.target.com/9gGaVQ\r\nByredo Tree House Candle: https://fave.co/3LFYt0u\r\nMasion Margiela ‘REPLICA’ By The Fireplace Candle: https://fave.co/3JVwXuR\r\n(Similar) Sizikato Frog Incense Burner: https://amzn.to/3JVqHDn\r\nAcrylic Four in a Row: https://fave.co/3Z7cAyR\r\nPlunge The Cold Plunge: https://fave.co/402EsWb\r\n\r\nLighting:\r\nUrban Outfitters Wally Table Lamp: https://fave.co/3lpHxkj\r\nElk Home Transit Chandelier: https://fave.co/3Jvd5gG\r\nEtsy Gallery Paint Co.
